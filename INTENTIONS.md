## Risk Profiles?

Approaches to differentiate risk profiles based on the "assets" they want to protect ([inspired by n8fr8](https://guardianproject.info/2013/07/16/modernizing-expectations-for-the-nouveau-secure-mobile-messaging-movement/))

 - Content (of documents, of communications)
 - Identity (of document's or communication's authors, of users of platforms, includes metadata)
 - Linkability (of content to people, of people between each other)
